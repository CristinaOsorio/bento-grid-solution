### What I learned

As part of improving my CSS Grid skills, I completed a series of interactive exercises on [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/), which provided a hands-on approach to understanding grid properties. Additionally, a tutorial video by [ edsHTML ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-muwduB2G1A&t=516s) was incredibly helpful for specific aspects like fitting images within the grid.

I also applied the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology in my code to ensure clean and maintainable naming conventions. Hereâ€™s a snippet of the project I worked on, showcasing a responsive design using CSS Grid:

```html
<main class="main-content">
    <section class="social-media">
        <h1 class="social-media__title">
            Social Media
            <span class="social-media__title-highlight"
                >10x Faster with AI</span
            >
        </h1>
        <img
            class="social-media__image"
            src="assets/images/illustration-five-stars.webp"
            alt="AI-enhanced image"
        />
        <p class="social-media__description">Over 4,000 Five-Star Reviews</p>
    </section>
    <!-- Additional sections omitted for brevity -->
</main>
```

CSS styles were applied using CSS Grid to create a layout that adjusts to different screen sizes:

```css
.main-content {
    display: grid;
    width: 100vw;
    gap: 1rem;
    max-width: 1400px;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 1rem;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(10, 75px);
}

/* Example style for a grid item */
.social-media {
    grid-column: 2/4;
    grid-row: 1/5;
    background-color: var(--purple-500);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
}
```

The combination of these resources and methodologies helped me consolidate my understanding of CSS Grid and how to efficiently integrate responsive, well-structured designs.

## Useful Resources

Throughout my learning process, I utilized a variety of resources that helped deepen my understanding of CSS Grid, BEM, and responsive design principles. Below is a list of the most useful ones:

-   **[CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/):** An interactive game that helps users grasp the basics of CSS Grid through progressively challenging levels. It was essential for building my foundation.

-   **[YouTube Tutorial by edHTML on CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-muwduB2G1A&t=516s):** A comprehensive video tutorial that covers creating the same project but using a different strategy than the one I implemented. This resource served as a guide to solidify my understanding with practical examples.

These resources, combined, provided a solid foundation and best practices for working with CSS Grid and creating clean, maintainable code.
